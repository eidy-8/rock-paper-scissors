# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML and JavaScript. The project's main goal is to help you learn the basics of JavaScript through hands-on coding. The game is played directly in the browser, and it involves typing your choice for each round of the game.

## Introduction

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a timeless game enjoyed by people of all ages. It's a game that combines luck and strategy, where players choose between three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The game outcome is determined based on the choices made by the players in each round.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript

## How to Play

Playing the game is easy and fun:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. For each round, a prompt will appear asking you to type your choice: "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
3. After typing your choice, the computer will randomly select its move.
4. The result of the round will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or tied.
5. The game will continue for a total of 5 rounds.

## Future Improvement

In the future, a graphical user interface (GUI) will be added to enhance the gaming experience. The GUI will make the game more visually appealing and user-friendly. Additionally, more features might be incorporated, such as score tracking and different difficulty levels.
